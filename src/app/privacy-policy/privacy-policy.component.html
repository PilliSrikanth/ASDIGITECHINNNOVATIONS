<p>When you provide us with personal information to complete a transaction, verify your credit card, place an order, arrange for a delivery or return a purchase, we imply that you consent to our collecting it and using it for that specific reason only.</p>
<p>If we ask for your personal information for a secondary reason, like marketing, we will either ask you directly for your expressed consent or provide you with an opportunity to say no.</p>

<p>If after you opt-in, you change your mind, you may withdraw your consent for us to contact you, for the continued collection, use or disclosure of your information, at any time, by emailing us at&nbsp;<strong>asdigitechinnovations@gmail.com&nbsp;</strong>or contacting us at: <strong> T-Hub, Plot No 1/C, Sy No 83/1, Raidurgam, Knowledge City Rd, panmaktha, Hyderabad, Serilingampalle (M), Telangana 500081<!--No 17, Aditi, 4<sup>th</sup> Lane, 7<sup>th</sup> Cross Teachers Colony 1 <sup>st</sup> Stage, Kumaraswamy Layout Bangalore – 560078--></strong></p>
<p>SECTION 3 – DISCLOSURE</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information if we are required by law to do so or if you violate our Terms of Service.</p>
<p>SECTION 4 – PAYMENT</p>
<p>We use Razorpay/Cashfree for processing payments. Neither of us store your card data on our servers. The data is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) when processing payment. Your purchase transaction data is only used as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is not saved.</p>
<p>Our payment gateway adheres to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Rupay, Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</p>
<p>PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.</p>

<p>In general, the third-party providers used by us will only collect, use and disclose your information to the extent necessary to allow them to perform the services they provide to us.</p>
<p>However, certain third-party service providers, such as payment gateways and other payment transaction processors, have their own privacy policies in respect to the information we are required to provide to them for your purchase-related transactions.</p>

<p>In particular, remember that certain providers may be located in or have facilities that are located in a different jurisdiction than either you or us.
